## User Experience (UX)

### User Stories

#### New Users:

The landing page will more geared towards new visitors and / or those new to Star Trek and wanting to know more. There will be clean and inviting information on what the visitor can expect to experience by visiting the museum by following the CTAS / links provided, as well as an image from each of the exhibitions to cultivate curiosity to learn more.

#### Experienced Users:

By experienced users I mean those that have visited the museum before and / or are fans of the Trek franchise and need less guidance on the page.

The other areas of the site will start with a short blurb about what the visitor will find on this page, followed by a couple of images from the museum alongside a short text. The idea is to pique the visitor's interest so they want to visit the museum. 

* Both pages will have short pieces of text, so as to help the visitor digest the information without being overwhelmed.

* Too many images can slow the loading of the webpage, so I will be limiting to one per paragraph/section.

* Each page will have a CTA that leads to the "how to get here" page to help steer traffic towards visiting the museum.

## Design

### Colour Scheme

The colour scheme is pre-determined with a variety of colours, I shall try to pick a few main colours from this large list that will be both UX/accessibility friendly but making the page look as Trek as possible.

This large colour palette is the LCARS (or Library Computer Access/Retrieval System) is the operating system used on most Trek series so any visitor familiar with the franchise will instantly recognise it. The challenge will be to make it as friendly for non Trek visitors/take into account any accessibility needs.

![Star Trek LCARS colour palette with 36 colours](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/7e55be12-cb5d-401b-af81-684157848bd2)

### Typography

Doing some research I discovered a Tweet that Mike Okuda, the graphic designer who created the LCARS theme, said that the Swiss 911 font was chosen although he preferred Helvetica Ultra Compressed.

![Tweet from Mike Okuda confirming the use of Swiss 911 font for LCARS](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/cb0853e5-fc06-4231-8475-72f2edb41fdf)

I had a look at these two fonts and agree that the Helvetica looks better as it is not as thick as Swiss 911, but the letters are very close together which is how they are on the LCARS system but for the sake of accessibility and UX I think they should have more spacing between them.

Seeing as this is not a regular font most people will have on their computers, I researched what Google Font could be a suitable alternative and have decided to use Antonio (as is used on [The LCARS](https://www.thelcars.com/) . This will ensure the page has a proper Trek feel to it without people needing special font packages installed. 

Taking a look at the example LCARS screen below, I decided 700 weight could be good for main titles, while 400 works nicely in sizes 48px for headings, and 21px and 16px for paragraphs/other text.

![Example of an LCARS interface from the Engineering department](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/a09ada33-4557-49cb-8dd7-ee63be9d79c1)

### Imagery

During my research I came across a favicon of a Star Trek badge that I plan on using on each page: <img src="https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/65ab9634-8241-4687-b2b9-5a961057c6be" width="50px" height="50px" alt="Pixelated favicon of a gold and white Star Trek badge">

#### Homepage

![Star Trek Pride selection of starships with various pride flags](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/58808344-6591-4ad4-ac8b-6b0f8a1f4f09)

#### Page: Star Trek Crews

This page will have 3 of the many different Trek crews due to time constraints, so I went researching to find 3 images as similar to oneanother as possible. Luckily through [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/) each of the 3 Trek pages have identical crew artwork which will help improve the UX/UI of the page. On this page, there is the possibility to link the other pages onto here. (in the blurb for one crew there could be links to the starship exhibition)

#### Exhibition: Starships

Similar to the crews page there will be details on the ship exhibition at the museum:

![Starship Voyager](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/10d119f9-8701-4bb0-92e0-74f25b9ce214)
![Space station Deep Space Nine](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/0405c7d2-a51e-4d1a-bdc6-ff5c95315814)

After speaking with my mentor I discovered that webp formats would improve the loading time and overall performance of my page, I went back and converted my images from png/jpg.

### Wireframes

My wireframes accidentally went rather hi-fi because I wanted to see how the background images and the strong LCARS colour scheme was going to work, but I finished the estimated design for desktop, tablet and mobile for the homepage, crew exhibition, starship exhibition, contact page and  404 error page.

#### Homepage

![Homepage wireframe design](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/5811ad4a-bfd6-44db-91be-8d49feb09a0a)

#### Crews

#### Starships

![Starships wireframe design](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/04201ee9-356b-4702-84f0-a781976a3058)

#### Contact

![Contact page wireframe design](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/da2f7882-beec-4049-afba-d6a5edcf6c03)

#### 404

![404 page wireframe design](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/d7632cb9-2617-4df9-91f5-f78e99276f74)

## Features

My site comprises of 5 pages:

The homepage, welcoming the user to the main page for the Star Trek Museum, introducing them to the project and informing them of what they can expect when visiting the museum. An image helps to break up the text portion to make it easier for the user to view the content without getting overwhelmed.

Beneath the introductory text are 3 buttons leading to the different sections of the site as a sort of CTA.

The Crews of Star Trek page showcases the 3 Treks that will be available for viewing along with an image of each crew.

The Starships page features the large scale replica models available for viewing at the museum.

The get in touch page has the phone, address and email for contact, along with a form for those who prefer, and a map (to a fake/incorrect address).

The 404 page (not counted in the 4 page site) has an image/gif of Captain Picard facepalming with a button link to get back to the homepage.

A 5th page simply lets the user know their contact form has been submitted, which helps the user to stay on my website rather than being sent to Githubs default response.

### General features on each page

Each page has the same header and nav bar, and the same footer with the (fake) socials available. The desktop version has the navigation bar in the form of links on the top right corner, whereas the mobile versions have a hamburger menu with a dropdown containing the same links.

The tabs have a favicon of the Star Trek comms badge mentioned in the ### Imagery section which is designed to fit well on Chrome, android and apple mobiles.

*** In the interest of openness, AmIResponsive was giving me a bottom scroll bar on the mobile device image, upon inspecting they have set the min-width to 97vw which is giving a scrollbar that doesn't exist in the dev tools.

### Future Implementations

1. I would like to have the background as a twinkling star scene, but without JavaScript that would be an excessively tedious manual positioning of dozens of stars. 
2. I would also like to have the site look more like LCARS panels in order to appeal more to Trekkies, but shaping those panels would require more time and practice as of now.
3. Lastly, I would like to refactor my CSS to include root variables to help future-proof the project as it would make changing the colours of my LCARS panels much easier.

### Accessibility

Some accessibility plans I have once I'm coding:

* Aria labels on any media links
* Semantic HTML for ease of screen readers (thus avoiding div soup)
* Descriptive alt text on any imagery
* Adequate spacing on typography to ensure readability
* Being mindful of colour contrast

## Technologies Used

#### Languages

HTML, CSS

#### Programs

[Github](https://github.com/) for uploading my code and having a place to create my live site via Github Pages.

[Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/) for my wireframe designs.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) for finding a replacement font that everyone would have access to.

## Deployment & Local Development

### Deployment

To deploy this page I have used Github pages.

How I deployed my page to Github pages:

1. Signed into ![Github](https://github.com/)
2. Located my repository [Star Trek Museum](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum)
3. Clicked on Settings, then selected Pages from the left menu.
4. Under Build and deployment I chose the source, which was the dropdown for Deploy from a branch.
5. For Branch, I chose main/root from the dropdown and saved.

![Screenshot of location of settings and pages on Github](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/a838481b-fd67-4d3d-8498-7e5388bf7732)

After a few minutes, my site is ready to view.

### Local Development

The local development section gives instructions on how someone else could make a copy of your project to play with on their local machine. This section will get more complex in the later projects, and can be a great reference to yourself if you forget how to do this.

#### How to Fork

How to fork this repo (numbers on the screenshot below align with the list):

* Go to the repository on Github [Star Trek Museum Repo](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum)

1. Click on the "fork" option on the repo.
2. Change the owner (optional, if you have multiple organisations/groups on your Githb) and choose the name.

* If you wish, add a description of your own or leave it as the default description by me.

3. Choose whether to copy the main branch only (which is recommended).
4. Click the green "create fork" button.

[How to fork screenshot](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/1d13c985-a952-4a1b-aba9-0a16f8c7dff6)


#### How to Clone

Once you have forked the repo you will have a copy of the codebase on your Github account, meaning you can then add to the code and create PRs to my main branch. You can then clone the repo and start working. If you just want to try the code out then there is no need to fork and you can just clone and have fun!

* If you're just cloning or not still on the same page, go to the repository on Github [Star Trek Museum Repo](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum) 

1. Click the green "code" button to activate the dropdown menu.
2. Choose SSH to show the correct link to copy.
3. Copy the SSH link by clicking the icon to the right of it.

[How to clone sreenshot](https://github.com/emmy-codes/Star-Trek-Museum/assets/70635859/69bcebed-eb2e-47f5-94da-3611cccb8f82)

4. Open your IDE (here I will be using VSCode).
5. Open your terminal.
6. type "git clone" (without quotation marks) followed by the SSH key.
7. Viola, now you have a copy on your local IDE!

## Credits

Thankyou to ![MDN form guide](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Forms/Your_first_form) for guiding me through making a form for my site

I have taken inspiration, font family and hexcode from [The LCARS](https://www.thelcars.com/). Whilst this site has a library for use, I only wanted to take what I could from looking at the page as I didn't want to output more than I could create on my own.

### Content

I have used ![OpenAI](https://chat.openai.com/) to create most of the text for me so I can focus my time on practicing with the code. I wanted to write the content myself but there is far greater knowledge needed of Star Trek than I currently posess and I wanted to limit my time spent searching for a complete source to give me a basis to write my own work off.

###  Media

The crew images are sourced from [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/)
The starships are from ![PNGfind](https://www.pngfind.com/freepng/star-trek/)


###  Acknowledgments

Thank you to my partner for his insight on media queries and guidance on the best practices for writing instructions on forking and cloning, as well as assistance for helping me adjust my site responsiveness to be less of a headache in the future (specifically: he helped me change my panel sizings from vh to % as well as using the newly implemented dvh to the body, which will apparently future proof my code as well as improve ease of responsive design).

Thank you to my classmates on Slack for assisting when I had questions regarding HTML tags, how to export wireframes in Balsamiq, and overall feedback of my page. <3 

### Retro/Reflections

In my [New Users](#new-users) section I planned to add image buttons beneath the text.

In my [Experienced Users](#experienced-users) section I planned to have a CTA button “how to get here” to take the user directly to the contact info page to help steer users towards visiting the exhibition.

The texts overall feel larger than I intended but it turned out to be hard to have enough detail to intrigue people without being too long. I have already cut off some text to help with this, perhaps in the future it can be minimised even more without affecting the quality of the texts.

I am happy with how the colour palette turned out, I feel I was able to keep it relevant for Trekkies with a generic image of space instead of different Trek background images, and the LCARs colour theme worked well for the text without causing accessibility/reading issues.

The font I took looks great and feels very Trek to me, and is easily readable.

I had originally planned to have a page showcasing the Starships exhibition and fully plan on adding it in the future, but seeing as the layout was going to be almost identical to the crews page, I decided to cut this from my MVP for the sake of time.

The header and footer came out nicely, although I had planned on adding social media links which are very important and will try to squeeze those in the last minute!
