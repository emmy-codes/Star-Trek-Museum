## AUTOMATED TESTING

### W3C Validator

[W3C](https://validator.w3.org/)

### JavaScript Validator

### Lighthouse

On first try of my crew page I received a disasterous performance score due to my images from IMDB being extremely large. I ran the images through Squoosh and was able to reduce the image size by 94%.

### Desktop Results

### Mobile Results

## MANUAL TESTING

### User Testing

I posted my website onto Facebook for my family and friends to trial and give their input. The decision was unanimous - despite my code passing all the automated testing, users were finding it hard to read the text due to the brightness of some stars in the background. After some panic and research I discovered linear-gradient which allowed me to place a semi-opaque black layer on top of the image, thus allowing for more readability whilst still seeing the majority of the stars.
